 ---
 - Total sales: To get a well detailed insight to the over all sales, we had to get a column for the revenue by multiplying the quantity by unitprice. which will give us an oversight of how much was generated by the company in the given time. Formula used: ```=product(number1,[number2])```
- Top performing product: products were analyzed to know our best selling products, regions that pulled the best sales, Months that had the most revenue. This analyzes was done with pivot table by summarising our data.
- Metrics: we calculated metrics such as average sales per each product.
