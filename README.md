  ### Data cleaning and Preparation
---
  In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
  1. Data loading/Inspection
  2. Delete duplicate data
  3. checked for missing values
  4. check for null values 

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
  EDA invloved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

  
  -  Total sales for each product
  - The highest selling product 
  - what is the number of sales transaction in each region
  - Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount
  - Product with no sales in the last quarter
  - The percentage of total sales conributed by each region
  - The monthly sales total for the current year.

 ### Data Analysis
 ---
 - Total sales: To get a well detailed insight to the over all sales, we had to get a column for the revenue by multiplying the quantity by unitprice. which will give us an oversight of how much was generated by the company in the given time. Formula used: ```=product(number1,[number2])```
- Top performing product: products were analyzed to know our best selling products, regions that pulled the best sales, Months that had the most revenue. This analyzes was done with pivot table by summarising our data.
- Metrics: we calculated metrics such as average sales per each product.

select product, sum (total_sales)as totalsale
from [dbo].[VW_Sales_Data]
group by product
```
select distinct product, sum (total_sales)as totalsale
from [dbo].[VW_Sales_Data]
group by product

### 2.number of sales transactions in each region----

select  region, count(Quantity) as numberofsales
from [dbo].[VW_Sales_Data]
group by region
```
### 3.Highest selling product by total sales value---
```
select top 1 product, sum (total_sales)as totalsale
from [dbo].[VW_Sales_Data]
group by product
order by 2 desc
```

### 4. Total revenue by product
```
select product, sum(quantity*unitprice) as revenue
from [dbo].[VW_Sales_Data]
group by product;
```

### 5.Monthly sales total by current year
```

from [dbo].[VW_Sales_Data]
where OrderDate > '2023-12-31'
group by OrderDate
order by 2 desc
```
```
select OrderDate, sum(Total_sales) Total_MonthlySales
from [dbo].[VW_Sales_Data]
where OrderDate like '2024%'
group by OrderDate
order by 2 desc
```

### 6.Top 5 customers by Total purchase Amount

select   TOP 5 sum(Total_sales) as Highest_sales , customer_id
from [dbo].[VW_Sales_Data]
group by customer_id
ORDER BY 1 desc
```

### 7.percentage of total sales contributed by each region

 ### Insights
 ---
After critical analyzes of the sales trend and overall performance, we were able to draw conclusions and understand the data. The following are insights gotten from the analyzes.
Here’s a more professional summary of your key points:

- A total of 68,461 products were sold, generating a revenue of $2,101,090.00. This amount is considered substantial for a company of this size, with an average revenue of $211.78 per product.
- The highest revenue-generating product is shoes, followed by shirts and hats. Conversely, gloves, jackets, and socks have the lowest sales. This trend indicates that customers prioritize fashionable items over those designed for warmth, likely due to the predominantly sunny weather, which reduces the demand for cold-weather apparel.
- Revenue distribution across four regions is as follows: the South contributed 44% of total revenue, the East 23%, the North 18%, and the West 14%. This data highlights a significant revenue gap between the South and the other regions.
- The South also recorded the highest quantity of products sold.
- Notably, there were no months with zero sales; products were sold consistently throughout the year.
- The analysis revealed that February had the highest sales figures, while the first two quarters of the year showed similar revenue levels. The last quarter recorded the lowest sales, with a significant spike in February compared to other months in the first half of the year.


   ### Recommendation
   ---
 Here’s a more professional version of your suggestions:

-While the current revenue is stable and indicative of growth, there is potential for greater revenue generation. The company should enhance its investment in advertising and branding to boost sales. 

- There should be reduction in the production quantities for gloves, jackets, and socks, as demand for these items is relatively low. Instead, they should ensure that products with higher demand, such as shoes and shirts, are adequately stocked.

- There should be increased investment in regions outside the South. Analyzing the factors contributing to growth in the South could provide insights that can be applied to other regions. Key areas to investigate may include the company’s location, branding strategies in those regions, staff performance, and the effectiveness of advertising and brand awareness initiatives.

- Production should be increased up during the first two quarters of the year, particularly in February, while reducing output in the last quarter when demand tends to be lower.
